# Welcome to Flask API with User Registration and Product List!
Flask API with User Registration and Product List is a RESTful API built using Flask,
Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Smorest, MethodViews, and Blueprints.
It allows users to register with their name, phone, email, and password, and provides a list of products with product name, price, items count, and owner.

you can create a new virtual environment and install
the required packages by running:


* python3 -m venv venv
